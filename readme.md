Many chapters in [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) reference web pages or end with "Follow-up resources" to papers and books.
This repo collects them for offline reading and archiving.
Web pages were captured and printed to PDF at their file times.

This is current to the v0.11.2 May 2016 release of the book.
Chapters not listed did not have references.

Not saved (consider [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) for videos):
  * Any Haskell packages, though I would probably accept a PR adding the .tar.gz's
  * Chapter 19: [Haskell Stack Mega-Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw), video
  * Chapter 26: [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929), full book is browseable but not available for free download
